Investsimples 

A web application where the user can learn in practice how to invest in the brazilian stock market in a simple way.

Background

This is a web application based on the finance, from CS50 web track, pset8, applied to the IBOVESPA, which is the main performance indicator of the stocks traded in B3 and lists major companies in the Brazilian capital market. My main goal with this application is to provide a tool for those who are not familiar with the capital market, so they can learn how to invest without having any risks. 

This project was built with Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and SQLITE3.
